      <h3>About Blog Posts</h3>

      <p>
        Alaveteli automatically imports posts from the configured
        <a href="https://alaveteli.org/docs/customising/config/#blog_feed">
        <tt>BLOG_FEED</tt></a> to display around the site. The feed is imported
        when the <%= link_to 'public blog page', blog_path %> is viewed.
      </p>

      <p>
        By default blog posts are listed by recency. When they're presented
        alongside <%= link_to 'taggable content', admin_tags_path %>, Alaveteli
        attempts to render relevant posts through matching tags. For example,
        blog posts tagged with "<tt>climate</tt>" would be matched with records
        (requests, authorities, etc) also tagged "<tt>climate</tt>".
